#Russian peasant multiplication
#In the Russian peasant method, the powers of two in the decomposition of the multiplicand
# are found by writing it on the left and progressively halving the left column, discarding any remainder,
# until the value is 1 (or âˆ’1, in which case the eventual sum is negated), while doubling the right column as before.
#Lines with even numbers on the left column are struck out, and the remaining numbers on the right are added together.[3]
